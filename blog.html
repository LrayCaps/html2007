                    <p style="font-family:Baskerville;">In elementary school, we had computer lab class, a period to teach and encourage healthy usage of the internet. Mr Burnett was a kind enough teacher, and I took his words to heart. Here's what to look for in a safe site, never share your username or password with anyone,
                        all advice in good faith. I remember well the lesson on search engines: That you should never go past the first page of Google, for
                        there you would find unreliable platforms and likely scams. And so we've stayed there on the first page of Google, trusting the words
                        of those older than us. They knew best after all, and when used correctly the computer is safe. Safety is where we stayed, and we have
                        slowly watched that first page of google rot and fester. Those first links upon searching are not there because they are reliable, they
                        are there because they pay Google. That media monolith even slowly began to push those links down, replacing the top results with their
                        own widgets and models, and now with AI too. We have trained our usage of the internet by traveling on these information highways: high
                        speed travel through the efficient direction of search engines. But with this centralization comes commercialization. Our data is drawn, 
                        quartered, and sold to the highest bidder. We give up choice for comfort, and with it our agency and creativity. Reweirding entails a
                        not a return, but a catabasis. We delve into the underbelly, pluck pieces of the framework, and emerge to construct something of our own.
                        Our computers are not the inhuman aspect to our relationship to the internet, it is the consumerism. It is the algorithms and the pandering,
                        the buying and the selling.</p>
